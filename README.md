# React Typescript Todo App

[DEMI LINK](https://pashamalyshkin.github.io/Todo_app/);

This app was created using React, Typescript, Bulma, and SCSS.
Re-rendering has been optimized using useMemo and useCallback.
Also, this app is using useContext hook to avoid unnecessary props throwing.
All the transformations are accompanied by react transitions.

You can add, rename, remove, and filter all the todos.
